### About ###

This folder contains the code for generating the datasets used in the *Collective Intelligence*
course (FEW_X_401047_2013_120), along with examples of their usage.

The course uses the book 
"Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications", by Toby Segaran (O'Reilly Media, 2007).

The provided datasets are meant to be used in implementations of the theory covered in the chapters on
"Making Recommendations" (Ch. 2), "Discovering Groups" (Ch. 3), "Searching and Ranking" (Ch. 4),
"Document Filtering" (Ch. 6) and "Finding Independent Features" (Ch. 10).


### IPython Notebooks ###
The code is provided in the form of IPython Notebooks, each of which is also available as a .py file export.

The links below visualize the the IPython Notebooks contained in this folder through the [IPython Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
